# hcira-project-23
Project for HCIRA, Spring '23

We have used the tkinter package in our submission. This is a standard GUI toolkit used for Pyhton. 
We have created an program in Python which does the following functionalities. 

  a. Instantiation of Black Canvas : 
  The code block from line 30 till line 33 performs the action for instantiating a blank canvas. 
    
  b. Drawing on canvas:
  The draw_line method on line 10 is used for drawing a line in the created canvas. It takes event as a parameter.

  c. Resetting the canvas :
  The clear_canvas method on line 25 is used for clearing the canvas. This method takes event as a parameter.
  
  We have provided different kinds of mouse click events such as "left click" ,"right click" ,and  "leftclick and draw" in the main program for different actions.
